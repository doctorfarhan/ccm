# Contributing to CCM Notes

Thank you for your interest in contributing to CCM Notes! This project aims to provide high-quality, evidence-based clinical references for critical care medicine.

## Guidelines

### Clinical Content

All clinical content must be:

1. **Evidence-based** — Reference current guidelines and major trials
2. **Cited** — Include source guidelines (e.g., SSC 2021, AHA ACLS 2020)
3. **Accurate** — Verify all drug doses, calculations, and clinical criteria
4. **Current** — Based on the most recent evidence and guidelines

### Code Quality

- Maintain the existing design aesthetic (IBM Plex fonts, clean layouts)
- Ensure mobile responsiveness for all new pages
- Keep files self-contained (minimal external dependencies)
- Use semantic HTML and accessible markup

### Submission Process

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a branch** for your feature (`git checkout -b feature/new-protocol`)
3. **Make your changes** following the guidelines above
4. **Test** on multiple devices (desktop, tablet, mobile)
5. **Cite sources** for all clinical content
6. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description

### Protocol Card Template

New protocol cards should follow the existing structure:
- 1080×1350px design (mobile responsive)
- Clear section headers
- Evidence-based content
- Footer with guideline references
- Consistent branding (CCM Notes)

### Clinical Notes Template

Comprehensive drug references should include:
- Pharmacology overview
- Dosing tables with multiple concentrations
- Step-by-step calculations
- Evidence base (key trials)
- References section

## Questions?

Open an issue for discussion before making major changes.

## Code of Conduct

This is a professional medical education resource. Maintain:
- Respectful communication
- Evidence-based discussions
- Focus on patient safety and educational value
